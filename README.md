Titles Formerly Known As
========================

Simple marionette project using ItemView, Composite View and Layout.

## What's it for?

Four?

It's my first Marionette (backbone) app. I have plenty of to-do apps, but no titles, so I built this.

## TODO's

* use local storage
* use remote storage
* try it on a mobile device
* compile the templates/views
* tests, damnit!
  * Jasmine
  * Karma
  * PhantomJS
  * code coverage?
* ~~use marionette's AMD pattern to split this into separate files~~
